ECGWaveCapture - an ECG acquisition system designed to capture ECG signals and display the ECG
waveform in real-time. This project aims to make ECG data acquisition accessible to everyone, promoting better healthcare and research possibilities.
We have used AD8232 module for acquiring ECG signals. The waveform was displayed on an application using the bluetooth transmission. ESP32 microcontroller was used and coded on Arduino platform. This data was transmitted to the application using IOT system.
